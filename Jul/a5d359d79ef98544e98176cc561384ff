Durban – A five-part mini-series called Making CONTACT: A K9 conservation story, which celebrates and profiles anti-poaching K9 units in South Africa’s nature reserves, was launched this week. The series tells the personal stories of five of the dogs and their handlers and was created by Hill’s Pet Nutrition, which sponsors over 46 dogs in the K9 unit in the Kruger National Park, two in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park and 14 in other parks around the country The series was launched on Monday and explores the companionship, perseverance and connection between the dogs and their handlers, as well as the important link with our natural environment. It also raises awareness of the key organisations, protected areas and individuals on the ground that are all working together to protect our natural heritage. “This heart-warming series not only recognises the amazing role that these dogs play in protecting our natural heritage but also their incredible handlers who, through their commitment to working with the dogs, are making a real difference in the fight against poaching,” said veterinary affairs manager at Hill’s Pet Nutrition, Dr Guy Fyvie. Johan de Beer, K9 manager at the Kruger National Park of South African National Parks, said 95% of their poaching arrests are made with the help of tracker dogs. De Beer said they hope that by highlighting the work these dogs are doing, South Africans will help to keep paws and boots on the ground and expand our K9 units.
