Durban - A 35-year-old man survived what could have been a fatal fall, after he allegedly jumped from the Howick Falls view point in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands on Tuesday. Midlands EMS spokesperson Roland Robertson said they received multiple calls just before 3pm about a man who fell from the Howick Falls. Robertson said when paramedics arrived at the scene they discovered that a local resident had reportedly jumped from the view point at the waterfall. He said a quick-thinking security guard at the scene called for help immediately and some bystanders started making their way down to the man. “Once Midlands EMS, SAPS search and rescue, Howick SAPS and multiple local security services arrived, the patient had been found and had started walking out with the help of bystanders,” he said. It is believed the patient's fall was slowed and stopped by multiple thick trees, bushes and rock ledges, he said. “The patient was assessed and found to have sustained moderate injuries which were treated on scene and he was transported to a local facility for further treatment,” Robertson said.
