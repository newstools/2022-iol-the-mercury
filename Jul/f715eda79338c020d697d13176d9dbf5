Durban — A truck driver was arrested while allegedly offloading crystal meth with a street value of R5.2 million in Hammarsdale. Provincial Hawks spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said the man, 33, was arrested on Thursday by Hawks officers from the Pietermaritzburg Serious Organised Crime Investigation and Hammarsdale police station. He said he was arrested for dealing in drugs. Mhlongo said officers had received information about a truck which was off-loading cargo in one of the warehouses in Hammarsdale, west of Durban. They proceeded to the warehouse and conducted a search. “Whilst opening boxes 35kg of crystal meth with a street value of approximately R5.2m was found,” Mhlongo said. “The driver was arrested and charged with dealing in drugs.” Mhlongo said the man appeared in the Hammarsdale Magistrate’s Court on Friday. “He will reappear on July 21 for a bail application,” Mhlongo said. Commenting on Facebook, someone said the incident happened where they worked – it was a clothing warehouse. They were watching. The driver had arrived to pick up, not off-load. Daily News
