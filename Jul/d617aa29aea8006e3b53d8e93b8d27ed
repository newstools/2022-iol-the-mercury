Durban - The United Association of South Africa (Uasa) has called for urgent government intervention as cash-strapped workers face yet another expense with the fuel price hike kicking in on Wednesday. The labour union was responding to the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy’s announcement of petrol price hikes by R2.37 (93) and R2.57 (95) a litre, and a diesel price increase  of R2.31 (0.05% sulphur) and R2.30 (0.005% sulphur) a litre. The price of paraffin will increase by R1.66 a litre. In a statement on Tuesday, the association said: “UASA believes the fuel price increase calls for urgent intervention as it shows inflation spiralling out of control. Gauteng consumers will fork out more than R26 per litre, which paints an ugly picture regarding transport cost and the overall cost of living.”  UASA also lamented the reduction of the fuel levy relief, saying: “The fuel levy falls from R1,50 per litre to 75c before the total levy is brought back in August.” It called for a permanent solution to the monthly fuel price crisis. “We can’t keep pleading with government each month on the same challenge,” it said. With the fuel price now well past the R25 margin, UASA said, small businesses which depend on generators during load-shedding will struggle to keep afloat. “How much more will they be forced to spend on fuel on top of the electricity tariff hikes?” asked the union. “The current situation is an economic disaster for cash-strapped workers who must match their disposable income with growing inflation rates and survive on the little they have left.” it said. Uasa said it trusted that the government would find a sustainable solution to address the crisis. THE MERCURY
