Durban - The DA in KwaZulu-Natal has announced the election of Thabani Mthethwa as the new leader of the party’s eThekwini caucus and member of the Executive Committee (Exco) in the eThekwini Municipality. The DA said the election took place at City Hall on Monday morning and included members of the caucus.  The party said Mthethwa addressed the caucus to thank DA councillors for their support and commitment in working to hold the ANC-led coalition in the municipality accountable, as well as placing the needs of residents first. “The DA in KwaZulu-Natal wishes Thabani well in his new responsibilities going forward and will continue to support the caucus in their challenging work in the metro.” The party said that in due course, the DA Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) will consider recommendations by the new caucus leader on their appointment of a chief whip. Mthethwa said he was honoured to have received the backing of fellow DA members. “I am honoured to be trusted to lead the DA caucus in eThekwini, but the office is not for me, it is to serve the people of eThekwini. We understand the challenges that they face,” he said.  The DA eThekwini caucus leader position became vacant after the resignation of Nicole Graham. Graham who will also leave her position as executive committee councillor in the eThekwini Municipality at the end of July, is headed to Australia to further her studies. Graham was accepted to pursue a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree in Leadership and Enterprise at the University of Sydney. THE MERCURY
