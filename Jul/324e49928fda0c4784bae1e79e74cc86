Durban — Four suspects have been apprehended by a private security company for illegal electricity connections in the Pietermaritzburg central business district. Mi7 National Group spokesperson Colin David said that on Tuesday before midnight, they received information regarding four men allegedly attempting to make an illegal electrical connection from a power source on Theatre Lane. “Mi7 armed response units were immediately dispatched and through a quick response time, caught the four suspects in the act,” David said. “The men were swiftly apprehended. In their possession were a drill, pick and electrical cord.” David added that the matter was handed over to the police for further investigation. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said: “We have checked with Pietermaritzburg SAPS, no such incident was reported.” Commenting on the incident, Sphamandla Nxumalo alleged that sometimes illegal connections were done by Eskom or municipal workers for extra cash. Colette van Loggerenberg said: “Just looking over the wall from our place onto the roof of the flats garages next door, household extension cables are used to give light to the people living in the garages. Cables are exposed to the elements. An accident waiting to happen.” Daily News
