Durban - Tourism organisations that fall under the Durban West Community Tourism Organisation have been granted more than R250 000 in funding from the city as part of the programme to promote tourism within the city. Six organisations under this category are set to benefit from the funding, down from nine that had benefited in the previous financial year after three were kicked out of the programme for non-compliance. A report before full council recently said that the Economic Development and Planning Cluster drives the Community Tourism Organisation (CTO) programme as part of promoting tourism growth within the eThekwini municipal area. In terms of funding disbursement approved by the municipal council, the CTOs engaged are expected to submit relevant documents prior to qualifying to receive grant funding from the municipality. These include audited annual financial statements and business plans to confirm tourism activities to be undertaken, it said. “The cluster initially engaged nine CTOs under this programme during the 2021/22 financial year. “However, a recommendation has been made to disburse funds to the six CTOs since the three other CTOs have been unable to submit the relevant documents to qualify for grant funding,” it said.  The report recommended that the Durban West CTO be granted funding in the amount of R255 000. It said that authority was to be granted for the Head: Business Support, Tourism and Markets to facilitate the disbursement of funds to CTOs through the MOA obligations, monitor and evaluate progress considering expenditure and keep council abreast of all developments around the CTO development programme.
