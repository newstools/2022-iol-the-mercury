Durban - The SA National Institute for Crime Prevention and the Reintegration of Offenders (Nicro) says the shootings and lives lost at taverns across South Africa are a sorrowful call for action. Nicro says the latest shootings in Orlando, Soweto, in Gauteng, as well as in Sweetwaters, KwaZulu-Natal, have a shocking resemblance to the Enyobeni tragedy. These latest incidents led to the death of 15 and four people, respectively. “Our communities are in dire need of support and intervention that will help protect against the ongoing loss of life under such circumstances,” said Betzi Pierce, CEO of Nicro. “We understand that these are separate incidents, but we can’t deny that they are pointing to a larger social issue that needs to be addressed. “The victims are fathers, mothers, caregivers, and in the case of the Enyobeni incident, children, who are losing their lives in taverns across the country. We need to band together and help our communities protect themselves against risks and threats to their safety, and ultimately their lives,” she said. Nicro is calling upon local stakeholders to support these communities and to stand together with those who have been affected by these tragic events. On Monday, Acting Transport, Community Safety and Liaison MEC Jomo Sibiya visited Sweetwaters and was alarmed by the high number of taverns and bottle stores in the area, saying that the issuing of liquor licences needed to be re-evaluated.
