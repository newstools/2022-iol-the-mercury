Durban - The community of kwaNxamalala in Sweetwaters, has been urged to stay united, especially after the fatal shooting at Samukelisiwe Tavern last weekend. The message of courage was expressed during a memorial service at a packed  Nxamalala Community Hall on Thursday. Former ward councillor Babashane Madlala said it was important for the community to stick together, especially under difficult circumstances. “This thing has shocked us all because we have never had such an experience over the years. Despite this setback, we must emphasise that it is important to unite,” he said. The former councillor appealed for the continued support to the affected families which had been demonstrated by the community over the past days. Sgoza Zuma, the uncle of Nkosinathi Mdladla, who was one of the four victims, said they were saddened by his killing. “When I got a call on Saturday evening the thought was that he had suffered a flesh wound and would be okay, but we were devastated when we received another phone call on Sunday morning confirming his death,” said Zuma. He described his nephew as a well-behaved individual, adding they were still wondering why he had been killed. “This thing has left all the affected families shocked and with a sense of disbelief, but we have to accept that their time had come,” Zuma added. He applauded the support that the families had received from the community and the local leadership, including the tavern owner. Some of the figures attending the memorial service included former Msunduzi Municipality Speaker, Jabu Ngubo. All four victims will be buried on Saturday.
