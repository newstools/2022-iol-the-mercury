Durban - After a two-year break, local celebrities turned up looking elegant and stylish for the Hollywoodbets Durban July.  The new main sponsors, Hollywoodbets, hosted a number of celebrities in the Greyville Racecourse Chairman’s Room, where they were treated to refreshments and entertainment.  Photographers followed them, while patrons asked for selfies.  This year’s theme was “Show Me The Honey”. Some of the best dressed celebrities who attracted attention included actress Jessica Nkosi, who made a grand entrance in a gold, tight-fitting dress with attractive decorations.  The organisers said the idea behind the theme was to inspire designers to focus on their creativity with adornments such as flowers that provide nectar and pollen that bees collect for food and to produce honey. Songstress Nandi Madida also caught people’s attention with a revealing dress.  Sportscaster Robert Marawa was among the best dressed male celebrities with his specially designed suit.  Hip-hop star and radio personality Proverb was the MC in the Durban Tourism marquee. He kept it simple with a brown suit, white shirt and white sneakers. Business people, politicians and influencers made grand entrances and revived the atmosphere of the pre-Covid-19 Durban July.  Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, was among politicians who attended the trophy handover for the main race. He wore a black suit with his signature hat.  KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala opted for a three-piece dark suit.  EFF Leader Julius Malema wore a black suit, while his wife, Mantwa, wore an orange dress.  SUNDAY TRIBUNE
