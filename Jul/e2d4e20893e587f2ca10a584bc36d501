Durban - KwaZulu-Natal Social Development MEC, Nonhlanhla Khoza, has urged society to unite against the continued murder of women in the province following the death of Thobeka  Nene, 41, allegedly at the hands of her cop husband. MEC Khoza said citizens had a role to play to restore the moral fibre of society, and protect vulnerable groups. Warrant Officer Mthokozisi Nene, 44, made a brief appearance at the Camperdown Magistrate Court on Monday, for the alleged fatal shooting of his wife Thobeka during an argument at their family home in Ntshanga township, west of Durban, two weeks ago. Speaking outside court, Khoza said that men should lead from the front in all campaigns aimed at curtailing the scourge of gender-based violence (GBV). The MEC added that it was imperative for communities not to be silent but to isolate all those involved in GBV cases. Speaking on the murder of Thobeka Nene, she said the law must take its course. "We are disturbed that our children have been robbed of a teacher, but our social workers will provide school children, the deceased’s biological children and the family with psycho-social support. We are pleased that the community has come together to oppose bail for this man. We will continue to monitor this case until it comes to an end," she said. Community members, the deceased two daughters, MEC Khoza, Member of the Provincial Legislature, James Nxumalo and Ward 4 councillor, Malombo Nxumalo, were among those who attended the court case. The case was postponed to July 13 for a formal bail application and Nene will remain in custody. THE MERCURY
