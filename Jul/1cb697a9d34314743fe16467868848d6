Durban — The Hawks head and Director of Public Prosecutions in KwaZulu-Natal said that there was an investigation into KZN finance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube’s alleged involvement in the misappropriation of drought-relief funds. In a joint statement, the Hawks and the NPA said after numerous media enquiries regarding Dube-Ncube’s involvement in the alleged misappropriation of drought-relief funds, they established that an investigation had been registered in 2019. “There have been investigations that were conducted from the outset and no suspect was ever identified. MEC Dube-Ncube was approached but it was to obtain clarity on the information received. She was never identified as a suspect or potential suspect,” the statement read. It said that the Hawks and NPA in KZN have no knowledge of the alleged plan. On Monday, our sister publication, The Mercury reported that the KZN ANC chairperson hopeful Dube-Ncube’s campaign will not be derailed by “allegations of fraud and corruption”. This is the word from campaign leader Wiseman Ngobese and comes after reports emerged in the weekend press indicating that Dube-Ncube was the subject of an investigation by the Hawks, over fraud and corruption. On Sunday, Ngobese said they were shocked to learn of an “investigation” against Dube-Ncube. “We are aware that law enforcement agencies have approached comrade Dube-Ncube, a few days before the provincial elective conference. As stated, such developments are worrying.” Ngobese warned that if the matter was not handled properly, it would compromise the elective conference. Office of the Premier spokesperson Lennox Mabaso said the office would not be drawn into commenting on party political issues. ANC KZN spokesperson Nhlakanipho Ntombela described the investigation rumour as malicious. Daily News
