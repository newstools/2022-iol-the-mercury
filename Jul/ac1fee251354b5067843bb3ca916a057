Durban — A KwaZulu-Natal house was left damaged after a truck driver lost control and crashed into it on Monday afternoon. Start Rescue spokesperson Warren Brauns said that around 4.30pm on Monday afternoon, they received an urgent call for help from a resident in the Cliffdale area who witnessed a truck lose control, smashing through a fence line and into her neighbour’s house. Brauns said Start controllers dispatched their partner Netcare 911, the Fire Department and Start medical teams to the scene. He said that on arrival, teams found that a truck had lost control veering off the dirt road, rolled down a bank in front of the house and then rolled back into the garage, damaging the house and two parked vehicles. “Teams found that the driver of the truck was entrapped. The driver had to be extracted using specialised hydraulic equipment. After the driver was rescued, he was found to have sustained moderate injuries. Teams stabilised and treated him on scene before being transported by Netcare 911 to a nearby medical facility for further assessment and care,” Brauns said. He said that at the time of the incident, the family was outside the house due to load shedding. However, load shedding added some extra challenges with communication and residents had to run up a steep hill to make contact with emergency services. Brauns added that the scene was left in the hands of the fire department while the truck was recovered. Police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said nothing was reported to Hammarsdale police station. Daily News
