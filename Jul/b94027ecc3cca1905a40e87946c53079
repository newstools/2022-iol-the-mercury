Durban - A minibus taxi driver sprang into action after one of his passengers went into labour while travelling from Inanda to Mandeni on Saturday. IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson Dylan Meyrick said paramedics received a call from the taxi driver after the  woman went into labour. Meyrick said IPSS’ medical crews located the taxi on the side of the N2. “On assessing the passenger (paramedics) realised there was no time to transport the woman to hospital, and safely delivered her baby girl in the ambulance,” he said. He said the woman, her 10-year-old daughter, and her new- born daughter were all safely transported to a nearby facility in good health. “On some days it's about bringing new life safely into the world. “Fantastic work by teams on scene, and congratulations to the mother on the birth of a healthy girl,” added Meyrick.   Last month, The Mercury’s sister publication, the Daily News reported that a 26-year-old woman gave birth to a healthy baby on the side of a road after allegedly waiting for four hours for medical assistance in Mhlasini, Verulam, north of Durban. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram said Rusa was contacted by Mhlasini residents and medics were dispatched to the location. “The female stated that she went into labour at 11am and contacted the provincial ambulance service. After waiting four hours she delivered the child on her own,” Balram said. He said the mother and the baby were transported to hospital in a stable condition. Meanwhile, in May, off-duty RK Khan Hospital midwife Gonum Govender, 64, helped a woman to give birth on Florence Nightingale Drive in Chatsworth, south of Durban. Community members assisted by securing surgical gloves, towels, a pair of scissors to cut the umbilical cord, a sheet and a blanket. After the delivery, the baby was rushed to RK Khan Hospital for further care by another nurse who works at a private hospital. THE MERCURY
