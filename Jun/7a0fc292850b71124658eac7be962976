Durban – The decision to change the slogan was made at the party’s highest decision-making body, the ActionSA senate, on Friday last week.  Party leader Herman Mashaba said the ‘Act As One’ slogan was a call to South Africans to unite in the interests of building a truly multiracial party in which all South Africans could find a political home.  He said the view of the senate was that the party has achieved that objective and already stood as the most diverse political party in the country. Mashaba said the new slogan would be captured in the party’s constitution as they adopt the election campaign message. “The rationale of this choice lies in our commitment to provide hope to all South Africans against the despair that has become associated with the failed political establishment. We must be the party that makes South Africans believe that our country can be fixed and to put real solutions on the table to address the real challenges faced by South Africans daily. “ActionSA believes our country is loaded with potential and its people are good, freedom-loving, and resilient people who have withstood nearly 3 decades of failed government. We see it as the mission of our 2024 election campaign to galvanise South Africans, of all backgrounds, that we can come together to Fix South Africa,” he added. THE MERCURY
