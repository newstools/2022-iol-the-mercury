Durban - The eThekwini Municipality says ongoing power outages in KwaNdengezi and surrounding areas are caused by an overload in the circuit during peak times. The municipality says despite recent improvements at the Mariannridge major substation during the first phase, the municipality has continued to experience intermittent load constraints on the circuit feeding KwaNdengezi and Zwelibomvu. “Due to the electricity load challenges especially during peak times, the Electricity Unit had to introduce load reductions affecting parts of KwaNdengezi, Zwelibomvu and Coffee Farm. This was also implemented in Impola, Mariannridge, Dassenhoek and Thornwood after some medium voltage cable faults,” said the municipality. The municipality says the overload on the circuit causes electricity to trip during peak hours between 4pm and 10pm.  “After electricity has tripped out, the municipality must energise all the circuits until full supply is restored. However, there are times where the Municipality initiates load reduction to prevent total loss of power supply to these areas.” As an interim solution, the municipality says it is redirecting the medium voltage cable feeder to the Mariannridge major substation. This is expected to be completed within a week. KwaNdengezi resident and mother of an infant, Lungile Ngubelanga says the power outage has caused a lot of frustration and loss of money. “It’s been such a frustrating time, food is spoiling, appliances dying. Raising an infant in these conditions has been the worst experience ever, she is scared of the dark and these cuts happen almost daily so I’m forever having to calm her down.  “I’ve also just gone back to work and have been working from home because of Covid-19, these power cuts also affect the network so I’ve missed some deadlines because I couldn’t submit stuff on time.” THE MERCURY
