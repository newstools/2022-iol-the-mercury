Durban - CITY officials might not get bonuses this year as the eThekwini Municipality is implementing austerity measures. Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda revealed this during a budget debate on Tuesday, saying that city workers across the board might not be paid bonuses. But the workers will receive their salary increment as per conditions set at the bargaining council. “Staff bonuses at all levels have not been budgeted for in terms of the austerity measures that we are putting in place,” Kaunda told the council on Tuesday. Speaking during the executive committee meeting on Monday, Kaunda had stated that there was no expectation for the council to pay bonuses when it could not afford them, saying bonuses were not a right. “However salary increments have all been budgeted for in accordance with the collective agreement as we always do,” he said. On salary increments, a report on the budget related resolutions stated: “That whilst we have provided for a 4.2 % increase in salaries and a further 1% for notch increases, this will only be payable subject to affordability. This will be on condition that the current cash collection rates are sustained and that there is no significant impact of Covid-19.” The budget was passed on Tuesday. The Mercury however understands that the matter could still be reviewed later on if the finances of the municipality improve. THE MERCURY
