Durban - This month the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) will host the International Flight Inspection Symposium (IFIS), taking place for the first time on the African continent at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre in Durban. The symposium is hosted in collaboration with the International Committee for Airspace and Standards and Calibration (ICASC) and is expected to attract delegates with a wealth of aerospace and international expertise from the continent, Europe, the US and Asia. SACAA said the event will provide a platform for leading aviation organisations to have networking opportunities with other aviation stakeholders from across the continent.  “We are working towards realising the African Union Agenda 2063’s continental aviation objectives. Meeting safety and security standards is critical to the success of the Single African Air Transport Market,” said SACAA’s director of civil aviation, Poppy Khoza. Khoza said the event’s significance is to provide the opportunity for aviation and the navigation sector participants from Africa to experience the importance of their field of work and how their contribution to safety fits into the world airspace integrated system.  The event will take place from June 20 to 24. THE MERCURY
