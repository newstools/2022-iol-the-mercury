Durban - An intensive multi-disciplinary operation was conducted following the theft of seven sheep worth R14 000 from a farm in Howick last week. The joint operation included members of Magma Security and Investigations together with another security company, the Pietermaritzburg K9 Unit and the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) in Pietermaritzburg. Magma Security and Investigations owner Shaheen Suleiman said on May 25 seven sheep were stolen from a farm in the Howick area. He said after an intensive investigation by all the role-players, an operation was conducted on Monday. “The vehicle used during the commission of this offence was spotted in the Boston area,” he said. Suleiman said one suspect was arrested and questioned. “A further follow-up was then conducted in the Dargle area where a second suspect from the neighbouring farm was arrested,” he said. The suspects and exhibits were handed over to the Stock Theft Unit and the sheep, valued at R14 000, were returned to the farmer, he said.   Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said the farmer alleged that he was at his farm in Howick when he noticed that seven sheep were missing. A case of stock theft was opened at Howick police station for investigation. “Two suspects aged 34 and 38 were arrested during a multi-disciplinary operation in the Impendle area,” she said. Gwala confirmed that all the stolen sheep were recovered from the suspects. Both suspects are expected to appear before the Howick Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. THE MERCURY
