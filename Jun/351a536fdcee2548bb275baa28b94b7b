Durban - Three new human rabies cases have been confirmed in South Africa. That was according to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) May communiqué. The NICD said that two cases were reported in Limpopo and the third was reported in the Eastern Cape. Additionally, two deaths from the Eastern Cape were reported as probable rabies cases; however, this could not be confirmed by laboratory testing. “In total, seven human rabies deaths were laboratory-confirmed in South Africa for 2022 as of May 20, 2022. These cases are reported from the Eastern Cape (three), Limpopo (three), and KwaZulu-Natal (one). In addition to the confirmed cases, four probable human rabies cases are recorded from the Eastern Cape,” the NICD said. It said that the five rabies cases reported here for the period April 21-May 20, 2022, involved children from the ages of two to 14. “In four of these cases, dog bite histories were reported. In one case the exposure history remains unclear. In three of the cases no rabies post-exposure prophylaxis was sought or provided and for the remaining two cases vaccination was provided with no rabies immunoglobulin,” the NICD said. It said that the administration of rabies immunoglobulin in category 3 exposures, by infiltration of all wound sites, is critical to prevent rabies virus infection. The immunoglobulin provides neutralisation at the wound site and the entry site of the virus, and prevents the infection from occurring. In March, the NICD said that by April 21, 2022, four human rabies cases had been confirmed in South Africa since the start of the year. The cases were reported in the Eastern Cape (two - Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality), KZN (two) and Limpopo (two). There were also two probable rabies deaths from the OR Tambo (Mthatha) and Amathole Districts (Fameni) in the Eastern Cape, reported in the first quarter of 2022. Daily News
