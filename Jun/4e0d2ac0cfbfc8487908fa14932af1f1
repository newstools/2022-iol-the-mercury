Durban -  THE EFF Student Command (EFFSC) says it plans to continue with protests at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) Westville campus today. Students from the Westville campus have embarked on protests since Monday, demanding the reinstatement of suspended staff including cleaners, gardeners and guards. EFFSC Westville campus branch deputy secretary Owami Sithole said even though there had been communication with some staff to return to work, they would continue with the protest until all staff had been reinstated. UKZN said destruction of property (two tractors and a container) was reported at its Edgewood campus early yesterday morning. It said protests and destruction of property were also reported at the Westville campus yesterday. It added that a fire took place at one of the rooms at the Oval residence yesterday however the cause of the fire had not been established. UKZN student Thami Khuzwayo said the protests began after university management decided to suspend about 200 staff members (cleaners, gardeners and security personnel) across its campuses. The DA Students’ Organisation (Daso) said it strongly condemned the destruction of property and the disruption of classes amid ongoing protests. “Students have not been able to attend classes and even though the university had made the online teaching and learning programme available to students, not all students have the means to access these,” said Daso UKZN member, Thabiso Phungula. Daso called on the protesting students to take the matter up through the right channels and engage with the university management. Regarding the suspended employees, the university said it could not comment on the matter due to employer-employee confidentiality and to protect the ongoing processes. The university said that despite the protests, there were no disruptions to its online teaching and learning. THE MERCURY
