Durban - The body of a 35-year-old man was found with dozens of stab wounds on Oakford Road in Verulam on Tuesday. Provincial police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said Verulam police were called out to Oakford Road at 7.15 am this morning. “He had multiple stab wounds on the body,” she said. Reaction Unit South Africa(Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram said the body of an unidentified man, who was bludgeoned and stabbed at least 40 times, was discovered in overgrown vegetation on an unpaved road next to a river. Balram said a passer-by contacted Rusa just after 8.20 am after he had made the discovery. “On arrival, Reaction Officers discovered a blood trail leading from the unpaved road to the body. “Medics examined the deceased and discovered multiple stab wounds to his neck, chest and back as well as blunt force trauma to his face,” he said. Balram said a pair of sandals were discovered on the road where the murder is believed to have occurred. “He was dragged into the bush. A broken beer bottle was also recovered along the blood trail. It could not be immediately confirmed if it was used in the killing,” he said. Police said a case of murder was opened at Verulam SAPS, and the matter is under investigation. THE MERCURY
