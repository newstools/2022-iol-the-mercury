Durban - South Africans were left astonished that a truck transporting beer lost its load and no one came to loot it. The incident was reported by eThekwini Secure’s Zain Soosiwala on Tuesday afternoon on their Facebook page. Soosiwala said the incident happened on the N3 towards Pietermaritzburg, just before Market Road. The truck was stuck in the emergency lane. Reacting to the Facebook post, people were astonished that everything was still intact. Muhammad Amod said: “Wait guys, this is not SA.” Abid Hussain said: “It's not SA and it can never be.” Bohani Hlongwane said: “Amazing... No looters yet in that area.” Some said to give it time: Sharlene Baijnath said that the load would not be there for long. Marc Putter said: “Give it two hours only to clean up the boxes and plastic.” Jesse Paton said: “Loading looting in 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... GO!” Others just joked about the situation: Suresh Meghoo said that if the load was lost near any informal settlement, the people would have helped them out and cleared it for free. Sabelo Mthimkhulu said the community must come together and assist in clearing the road. It was such a busy road. Daily News
