Durban — Four wanted suspects were killed in a hail of bullets during a shoot-out with police and private security in KwaMashu, north of Durban. Two other suspects were arrested. Marshall Security managing director Tyron Powell said four wanted suspects were shot and killed and two others arrested during a shootout with Marshall Security and the SAPS Phoenix Trio Crimes Unit on Tuesday night. Powell said the gang was linked to various business robberies, armed robberies and hijackings in the Durban North, Greenwood Park and Verulam areas. He said that at 7pm on Tuesday night, members of their Special Operations Team spotted a wanted vehicle, a silver Toyota Yaris. It was known to have been involved in several business robberies, armed robberies and hijackings travelling on Queen Nandi Drive.  As the suspects noticed the Special Operations Team members following them, they immediately sped off and opened fire on Marshall Security members, who then returned fire. “Our members together with the SAPS Phoenix Trio Crimes Unit pursued the suspects into KwaMashu B section, where the driver of the Yaris lost control of the vehicle and crashed into a taxi, whereafter a shoot-out ensued. Four suspects were shot and killed, and two were arrested on scene,” Powell said. “Upon searching the vehicle two unlicensed firearms, both of which had the serial numbers removed, as well as a toy gun was found, along with multiple cellphones and additional number plates that had been used in the commissions of other crimes.” Powell said that police attended the scene and would be investigating cases of attempted murder, possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, as well as possession of a hijacked motor vehicle​.​​ Police had not commented by the time of publication.
