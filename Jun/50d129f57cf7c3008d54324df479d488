Durban - IFP councillor in the eThekwini Municipality Mdu Nkosi has challenged the municipality on its plans to charge residents living on Ingonyama Trust land for services. He was speaking during the debate on the budget this week.  Responding to remarks by eThekwini mayor Mxolisi Kaunda that the city leadership was engaging with Amakhosi in the rural areas that fall under the municipality to discuss the proposed charge of a flat rate of R100 for services, Nkosi said the IFP was not happy with the proposal. “We want to register our dissatisfaction about the charge that has been proposed, the R100 that has been proposed in rural areas. We call this madness. I know, Mr Mayor, that what you are saying is not true. The Ingonyama Trust board has not been consulted. If you have consulted with Amakhosi, certain Amakhosi have been consulted. But not all Amakhosi,” said Nkosi. Nkosi said they were against the item which formed part of the budget passed on Tuesday. “We are not clear if you say R100 is proposed for everyone. But the properties are not the same. Also have we put infrastructure in rural areas? The answer would be no. People need to know what it is that we are charging them for?” While delivering his budget for the 2022/23 financial year, Kaunda said the city was also engaging with the Ingonyama Trust Board on the issue of their debt. “We are also encouraged to improve our communication with the Ingonyama Trust Board in respect of their outstanding debt to the city. “The Amakhosi have been engaged regarding the proposed flat rate of R100 and have agreed we must take this consultation to other areas to assist with further engagement,” said Kaunda. The NFP has also threatened a massive protest in the city if the R100 charge is implemented. THE MERCURY
