Durban - KwaZulu-Natal Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Sipho Hlomuka has expressed concern over ongoing attacks on councillors across the province.  Addressing a meeting of the portfolio committee in Mayville, Durban, on Tuesday, the MEC called on the police to arrest those responsible for the attacks which often result in killings. “We wish to express our concern once more at the attacks that have been made against councillors within our province. Last week we learnt with shock and sadness of the assassination of Councillor Mxolisi Buthelezi who was a councillor within the uMkhanyakude District,” Hlomuka told committee members. He cited reports on the attempted murder of another councillor in the Abaqulusi Local Municipality, adding that this was equally worrying, and urged for action to be taken. “We wish to call upon law enforcement agencies to leave no stone unturned in the quest to apprehend the cowards that are responsible for these blatant acts of criminality,” the MEC said. Hlomuka said while the department noted the attacks against councillors, they were equally encouraged by the work being done by the SAPS to arrest and prosecute those who are responsible for the attacks.
