Durban - Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) said a shooting occurred in Verulam this morning when a man was approached by two men in a silver Datsun Go. Rusa said reports from the scene indicated that the vehicle stopped next to the man and two men from the vehicle confronted him and attempted to force him into the vehicle, but he resisted. The company said the man reported that the driver then exited the vehicle and allegedly fired three shots at him. One bullet struck him in his right thigh. The suspects then got back into the vehicle when the victim smashed the windshield with a brick. “He explained that he borrowed R600 from a loan shark approximately two months ago which he paid back. Yesterday the loan shark called for payment of his interest which amounted to R800. The man disputed the amount,” said Rusa spokesperson Prem Balram. Rusa said the driver was identified by the victim as the loan shark. “Reaction Officers conducted an extensive search for the suspects, however, no arrests were made,” said Balram. THE MERCURY
