Durban - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the north coast has raised questions over an event hosted by the King Cetshwayo District Municipality over the past weekend, calling for clarity on whether it had been included in the municipality’s budget. EFF councillor Nkululeko Ngubane, who has since written a letter to the municipal manager, also questioned the value behind holding the event over the past weekend, which included a beauty pageant and a gala dinner and horse racing event. The district is made up of Richards Bay and surrounding areas and is regarded as one of the key economic hubs in KZN. According to the EFF, the hosting of the event needed to be fully explained in order to determine whether any rules were flouted in the process. Some of the questions raised by the EFF included: *whether the normal supply chain management were followed in appointing a service provider. *the overall amount spent in the events. In addition to this, the EFF also demanded to know by the end of Monday, June 27 whether: “The Acting manager shall understand that we are in government and we are accountable to our constituency hence the clarity seeking questions, said Ngubane, who is also a councillor.  Attempts to get comment from the mayor Thami Ntuli were unsuccessful. This story will be updated when he responds. THE MERCURY
