Durban - A driver captured a video of a pedestrian hanging onto the back of a truck travelling on the N3. In the 25-second clip the driver is heard saying that he has been following the truck from Pietermaritzburg all the way into Durban. The driver purports that the pedestrian hanging onto the back of the moving truck on the freeway is a whoonga addict, referring to him as a “phara”, a word generally used to describe whoonga addicts. “I wonder where he is going. Now you see what kills paras. Do you see him? We’re on the N3 from Pietermaritzburg to Durban. We have been driving behind this truck on purpose, to show you all this,” says the driver, who is with a passenger in the car who is also heard commenting in the audio of the video. The driver gets closer to the truck, still recording, showing a more clear image of the person holding onto the back, who looks back at the videographer. “Do you see him? He now doesn’t know how he is going to get off this moving truck,” the driver says, as the man peers from the left side of the truck, looking ahead. The man after this leans his body to the left, as if trying to get off, signalling to the driver with his hand. “He is stuck now and doesn’t know how he will get off, there he is,do you see him? He’s signalling to the driver now trying to get him to stop.” Daily News
