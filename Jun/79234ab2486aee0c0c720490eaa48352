Durban - Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane who has not made public appearances since the recent ANC provincial elective conference – is alleged to be recovering at home after he was allegedly poisoned. A highly placed source with the knowledge of the matter told the Daily News that Mabuyane escaped death at the hands of some of his comrades who poisoned him at the elective conference which was held a month ago. He said Mabuyane and his team decided to keep the information away from the public. “He is recovering from home; it was really bad but he will survive. It appears that some comrades are not happy with him. That is why he has not been seen since the conference, they almost took him out.” “His camp knows what happened and they are not saying anything but we all know what really happened,” said the source. When the Daily News reached out to Mabuyane and asked about the matter, he replied stating that he had lost his phone and no longer had contacts but refused to disclose details about the poisoning. Last week at the funeral of AmaMpondo King Zanozuko Tyelovuyo Sigcau, Mabuyane did not show up despite the presence of his political ally President Cyril Ramaphosa who was among the dignitaries in attendance. Mabuyane was re-elected as chair of the province defeating his former ally, the former provincial treasurer and MEC for Public Works Babalo Madikizela. He got 812 votes while Madikizela only managed to secure 662 votes after an intense back and forth conference that almost collapsed due to disagreements over the credentials. His victory was seen as a boost to the embattled Ramaphosa who is expected to go toe to toe with KwaZulu-Natal’s Zweli Mkhize and EC’s Lindiwe Sisulu who have been endorsed by some branches as the next leaders of the ruling party. The ANC conference is expected to sit in the Western Cape in December. Daily News
