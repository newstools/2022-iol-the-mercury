Durban - KwaZulu-Natal police are investigating charges of business robbery and kidnapping after armed robbers struck the SA Post Office branch in Ceza, northern KZN. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said it was alleged that on Wednesday at 7.30am, the branch manager was kidnapped from his home by a group of armed men and taken to a post office branch in Ceza. His two colleagues were also kidnapped by the same suspects and they were all taken to the business premises, Gwala said. “The suspects took an undisclosed amount of cash from the safe and they fled. “Charges of business robbery and kidnapping are being investigated by Ceza SAPS,” Gwala said. South African Social Security Agency spokesperson Sandy Godlwana said that the branch manager reported that seven suspects took him from his house to open the office. She said he told the robbers that he did not have the office keys with him, so they proceeded to collect two tellers and forced them to open the branch. She said that another four suspects were left behind with the branch manager’s wife. “After they took the cash they returned all of them, the branch manager and two tellers, back to his house. Estimated cash of R300 000 was stolen,” Godlwana said. She said the branch manager lives in Ulundi, northern KZN. Daily News
