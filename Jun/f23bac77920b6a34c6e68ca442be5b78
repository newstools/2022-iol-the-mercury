Durban - Facebook users have been left divided by a report that drug addicts allegedly set a house on fire in Verulam, north of Durban, recently. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) had reported that drug addicts had set the house on fire. Spokesperson Prem Balram said Rusa stood off at the scene of the house fire on Ireland Street in the Verulam central business district on Friday. “The house is believed to have been set alight by drug addicts who stripped the property of all its valuables after the owner passed away in August 2021. The property has since been abandoned,” Balram said. He said eThekwini Fire & Rescue Services were in the process of dousing the flames. Commenting on Rusa’s Facebook post about the fire, Sagran Venkatas said the house had been vacant for a while. “Really sad about what’s happening in our surroundings. Drugs are getting worse in Verulam. Something needs to be done fast,” Venkatas said. Snoopy Neethia said the owner of the house was a retired teacher who lived there alone until she died from Covid-19-related complications last year. “The house was locked with everything in it due to high crime. Everything was stolen... ” Neethia said. Andy Plillay said: “Guys, where is the fire department in Verulam? Looks like they never saw the smoke. This house was completely burnt down before they showed up. Residents should be worried if this is their response time to an incident in the CBD.” However, some Facebook users were divided about the allegation that drug addicts might have set the house on fire. Mayaya Zasembo Mbk said: “... I don't believe those drug addicts will set a house on fire, which happens to be their shelter. Why would they? What will they benefit? Maybe someone in the neighbourhood was tired of them camping here (my thoughts).” Anele HoneyPot Ngcobo said: “Most likely they were kicked out of the house and they decided to burn it down. Probably they were squatting there.” Daily News
