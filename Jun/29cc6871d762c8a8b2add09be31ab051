Durban - The long arm of justice finally caught up with four suspects more than two months after they robbed a teenager in the Durban North area when the vehicle they were travelling in was spotted in uMhlanga last week. Tyron Powell, Marshall Security’s managing director, said that on March 30 at about 4.30pm, the Emergency Dispatch Centre was alerted to a robbery that had occurred on Lansdowne Crescent in the Durban North area. Powell said multiple armed response officers and Special Operations team members were dispatched to the scene to assist and investigate. “Upon further investigation, it was established that two male suspects and one female suspect in a silver Toyota Yaris approached a teenager who was skateboarding on Lansdowne Crescent and requested to use his cellphone as they had run out of airtime and desperately needed to make a phone call,” he said. The teenager, wanting to assist, handed his phone over to the suspects to use, he said. “As the suspects pretended to make a call, one of them exited the vehicle and forcefully removed the teenager’s skateboard, after which he jumped into the vehicle and fled the scene towards Beachway,” he said. According to Powell a search for the wanted suspects and vehicle was conducted by the team, but they managed to evade arrest. He said a case of theft was then registered at the Durban North police station. Powell said that last Thursday at about 1.30pm members of Marshall’s Special Ops Team spotted the vehicle with the same number plates travelling on Lighthouse Road in uMhlanga.   “Together with the assistance of the Durban North SAPS, the vehicle was brought to a stop where four suspects were immediately arrested,” he said. Powell said the suspects, as well as the wanted vehicle, were handed over to the Durban North SAPS for further investigation and processing. THE MERCURY
