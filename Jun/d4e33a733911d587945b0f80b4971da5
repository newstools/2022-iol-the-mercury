Durban — The SA Association for Marine Biological Research (Saambr) has revealed that Tweni, the subantarctic fur seal who was stranded on the beach at Umtentweni at the end of May 2022 was nearing his release date. “Although the scales reflect a mere 3kg increase since his initial weigh-in, we believe that his initial recorded weight did not accurately reflect his actual body weight due to the dense layer of sand buried deep in his fur,” Saambr’s Ann Kunz said. “He now weighs 59kgs which is a satisfactory weight for a male subantarctic fur seal of his age. However, as he only has one functioning eye, we are hoping that he gains a few more kilograms before we release him in order to give him a better chance of survival.” Kunz said that Tweni had the most “beautiful and soulful” voice, which can be heard in the early mornings throughout the downstairs passages and offices of the facility where he is being cared for. “He certainly knows how to call for attention and gets visibly excited at feeding times.” She said Tweni, who had a beautiful face, was a “real charmer” and it a was no wonder his fan base was growing so fast. “If all goes well, will soon be sharing news of his release,” Kunz said.
