Durban - A  bull terrier-Staffie cross-breed is on the mend is on the mend after it was rescued from a septic tank on a construction site on Wednesday. Start Rescue spokesperson Warren Brauns said they received a call through one of the neighbourhood watch groups in the Upper Highway area about a dog in distress. “On arrival, team members found what appeared to be a large bull terrier cross Staffie which had fallen into a new septic tank on a construction site,” Brauns said. “The dog was clearly in distress and behaving erratically.” Brauns said that without any indication of how long the dog had been trapped, the team made the decision to contact the Kloof and Highway SPCA, requesting their help. He said that with the aid of the SPCA and local residents, the rescue team set up a rope system which allowed them to put slings around the dog and pull him to safety. “Once the dog was safely out of the septic tank, he was handed over to the SPCA where he was assessed.” “Fortunately, apart from slight dehydration, the dog was found to be free of any injuries and was later reunited with his family,” Brauns said.
