Durban - IFP founder and President Emeritus Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi says young people need to raise their voice against any form of abuse committed, especially by those in public office.  He said this when delivering the keynote address at an IFP Youth Brigade rally in Stanger on Sunday, where he decried the challenges many young people face. “With all that you face, from joblessness to gender-based violence, from a lack of safety to a lack of hope, you need to be reminded that you are not alone. You are not powerless. You have a voice,” said Buthelezi. He added that, much like the 1976 generation, young people of today need to demonstrate courage in dealing with the many challenges they faced. “You need to make those in authority listen. But you need to find a way to do it without destroying your own future. Make yourself heard, not by breaking down infrastructure, looting or harming. But by pooling the vast creative energy within this generation and mobilising a groundswell of peaceful protest in whatever form that must take,” Buthelezi said. According to the IFP leader, the youth of 2022 are standing at a crossroads, with one direction filled with destruction and the other with hope. He called on young people to make use of every opportunity to help shape a better country. “Show the corrupt and the arrogant gatekeepers of power that never will the youth of South Africa accept their future being stolen and abused,” Buthelezi said. The gathering was also addressed by IFP Youth Brigade national chairperson Sanele Zondo. THE MERCURY
