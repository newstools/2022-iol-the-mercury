DURBAN - A motorist was shot during a hijacking of his Mercedes Benz this week. Marshall Security’s Tyron Powell said in a statement on Thursday that the incident took place on Tuesday afternoon. “At approximately 4.40pm, members of our Special Operations Team were activated to assist Tracker SA with locating a Mercedes Benz that had been hijacked in the Ntuzuma area, where the motorist had been shot during the hijacking. “Members of our Special Operations Team immediately responded to the last known location of the hijacked vehicle, and it was recovered within 30 minutes of being activated by members of our Special Operations Team and the Tracker ground team. The vehicle was found abandoned on a dirt road in KwaMashu A-Section, riddled with bullet holes.” Powell said the victim was rushed in a private vehicle to KwaMashu Poly Clinic in a stable condition.
