ANC Women’s League President Bathabile Dlamini has praised former President Jacob Zuma for demonstrating exemplary leadership and abiding by the law. Dlamini, a known Zuma supporter and a Cabinet minister during his presidential term, has also suggested that the former president should have taken legal action against former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela. Taking to Twitter on Wednesday, the Women’s League president seemed to question the legitimacy of the State Capture Commission headed by Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. “President Zuma should have suspended Advocate Thuli Madonsela. We are learning, but I take my hat off for him for being a law-abiding citizen. A lot of wrongs happened here, allowing people to use him to flout the processes of appointing a Judge to head a commission. Corruption,” she wrote on her account. This week, Chief Justice Zondo is expected to deliver the last report on the findings of the commission, which has been looking at how certain individuals allegedly sought to milk the state coffers dry over a prolonged period, using their proximity to Zuma in order to achieve this. Dlamini also questioned the apparent disquiet over the suspension of current Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane by President Cyril Ramaphosa, just days following the revelations of millions of foreign currency in his farm back in 2020.  “Actually, my conscience and my being does not allow me to keep quiet about what has been done by those that purport to be standing for human rights and defenders of human rights to Advocate Mkhwebane. It’s sad. I have been trying to suppress it, my inner being is refusing,” Dlamini continued. Her remarks sparked a lot of reaction with some supporting, while many criticised her, even questioning the timing of her comments. THE MERCURY
