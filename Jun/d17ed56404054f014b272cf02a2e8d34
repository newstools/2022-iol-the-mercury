Durban - Former eThekwini mayor and current ANC eThekwini chairperson Zandile Gumede and her co-accused in the multimillion-rand Durban Solid Waste tender fraud case will appear in the Durban High Court on July 18 for the start of the trial. This after both the State and defence teams for the accused ironed out all outstanding issues yesterday at a pretrial conference. The trial will start the weekend after the ANC provincial elective conference is expected to be held. Advocate Jay Naidoo, representing the former mayor, confirmed that they were ready for the trial. National Prosecuting Authority provincial spokesperson Natasha Ramkisson-Kara described yesterday’s court hearing as dealing with purely administrative issues. Former eThekwini city manager Sipho Nzuza, who is also an accused in the matter, was seen making his way to court yesterday. It is understood that Gumede did not attend the hearing. Gumede’s supporters told The Mercury that they had not attended yesterday’s court appearance as they knew that it would just be a brief exchange among lawyers. They indicated that with the trial date now set, they would come in numbers to demonstrate their support. “Mam Gumede has and continues to enjoy the support both in and outside eThekwini Region because we believe in her innocence. You will see on the date of the trial the kind of support she has,” said an ANC member in the region Njabulo Mchunu. Political analyst Thabani Khumalo said Gumede’s court appearance would be used by the Radical Economic Transformation (RET) grouping, which is aligned to former president Jacob Zuma, to show its strong support base. He noted how in many regional conferences in KZN over the past few months, the grouping had managed to win outright. Khumalo insisted that Gumede had been emboldened with the recent victory at the regional conference where she trounced eThekwini speaker Thabani Nyawose for the position of regional chairperson. “What you will see is what we have witnessed in the past with former president Jacob Zuma and suspended secretary Ace Magashule where court appearances are used to galvanise political support,” said Khumalo. Gumede had been lobbied by some party members to consider running for ANC provincial treasurer at the provincial conference but this is unlikely owing to the court case and the ruling party’s step-aside policy.
