Pietermaritzburg – The South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) has advised motorists on the N3 highway of a planned partial road closure owing to construction.  The agency is undertaking major road upgrades between Camperdown and Hilton as part of the multibillion-rand upgrade of the N3 that links the economic hubs of Johannesburg and Durban. The ugrades will save motorists and the freight industry 6 300 hours a day.  Ahead of the public holiday (Youth Day) Sanral has informed road users that the section of the N3 national road between Lynnfield Park and Ashburton in Pietermaritzburg will be partially closed between 7pm on Wednesday, June 16, and 5am on Thursday, June 16. Traffic will be reduced to one lane, said Jason Lowe, Sanral Eastern Region’s Project Manager. “The partial closure will be done because of milling and replacement of the road surface upgrade on this section of the road,” he said. “We appeal to road users to reduce their speed to 60kp/h as indicated on the construction site. Accordingly, motorists can expect delays up to approximately one hour,” Lowe said. He apologised to road users for the inconvenience caused. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
