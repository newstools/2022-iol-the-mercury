DURBAN - The Pietermaritzburg High Court convicted and sentenced the killer of a Kokstad K9 unit officer in 2018 to 20 years imprisonment for murder and 15 years for robbery. On Wednesday, Ndumiso Memela, 26, was imprisoned for the murder and robbery of Sergeant Thembinkosi Buthelezi. Buthelezi was shot and killed on September 21, 2018, and robbed of his service pistol while he was off duty at Imbali township in Pietermaritzburg. Hawks spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said Memela appeared in court several times until he was convicted and sentenced. “He was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for murder and 15 years imprisonment for robbery. His sentence will run concurrently,” Mhlongo said. A case of murder was reported at Plessislaer police station, and the case docket was allocated to Hawks members from Pietermaritzburg Serious Organised Crime Investigation for a thorough investigation. “Sergeant Buthelezi’s service pistol was recovered in Memela’s vehicle in the Inanda area the following day. Memela claimed that he was hijacked the previous day and was eventually arrested in the Copesville area, Pietermaritzburg, in January 2020. He was charged for murder and armed robbery.” Meanwhile, on Friday, Police Minister Bheki Cele is expected to release the crime statistics for the third quarter of 2021/2022, reflecting on crimes that occurred between October 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021.
