DURBAN - A vehicle that was stolen yesterday in Durban North was found stripped hours later in the Amatikwe area near Inanda by Marshall Security.  The incident was confirmed by spokesperson for Marshall Security Tyron Powell.  “At approximately 5.10pm yesterday, members of our Special Operations Team were activated by Tracker SA to assist with tracking a silver VW Polo that had been stolen from the Athlone area.” Powell said the vehicle was found completely stripped.  “After a few hours of extensive tracking, the vehicle was found abandoned at a chop shop in the Amatikwe area, completely stripped. It had been fully dismantled with just the frame remaining intact, and the contents discarded.” Powell said the theft of the vehicle occurred somewhere between 3pm and 4.30pm.  “It was located by members of our Special Operations Team, Tracker SA, SAPS and other private security companies at approximately 9pm.The scene was secured and will be investigated further by the SAPS.” In a separate incident, Marshall Security recovered a hijacked vehicle in the Lindelani area in uMlazi on Monday after the vehicle was taken from a motorist in Avoca.  Powell said members from its Special Operations Team and armed response officers had responded to the hijacking. “Upon their arrival it was established that four armed suspects in an unknown vehicle with tinted windows had pulled up behind a motorist in a Chery Tiggo a couple of minutes after they had parked in the driveway. The suspects produced firearms and demanded cash and cellphones before proceeding to steal the Chery Tiggo and firing a shot as they fled the scene.” Powell said its members set off on a manhunt for the suspects along with the SAPS Phoenix Trio Crimes Unit.  “An hour and a half later, just after 12h30, the stolen Chery Tiggo was found abandoned in the Lindelani area. The scene was handed over to SAPS for further investigation.”   THE MERCURY
