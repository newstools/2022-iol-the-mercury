DURBAN - Two men who are charged with the murder of Amajuba District Municipality Speaker Reginald Ndima made their second appearance today at the Newcastle Magistrate’s Court.  This was confirmed by National Prosecuting Authority KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson Natasha Kara. Ndima was shot dead by assailants as he was arriving at his home in Newcastle in late January 2022. Ndima was elected speaker of Amajuba District Municipality after last year’s local government elections. She said the case against Mhlonishwa Sokhulu, 43, and Sbusiso Chocolo, 29, was adjourned to February 21 for their addresses to be verified. IFP national spokesperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa said: “ We therefore welcome the news that two suspects charged with councillor Ndima’s murder appeared in the Newcastle Magistrate’s Court. As the IFP, we trust that the wheels of justice will turn swiftly, and that if found guilty, the suspects will face the full weight of the law.” Hlengwa said that the party’s “thoughts and prayers remain with Ndima’s family, friends and colleagues in this challenging time”. The IFP had previously described Ndima as a humble and responsible servant of the people who diligently dedicated his life to public service. THE MERCURY
