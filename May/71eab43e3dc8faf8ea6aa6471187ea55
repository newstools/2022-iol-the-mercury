DURBAN - A seal which was discovered in distress on Winklespruit Beach in Amanzimtoti at the weekend is on the road to recovery after Blue Security, community neighbourhood watch members and the SPCA stepped in to assist the mammal. Blue Security said its teams were alerted to an emergency of a different nature on Saturday afternoon. “A very tired seal landed on Winklespruit Beach. As she was resting, local beach management staff and the SAPS were on the scene and secured the area,” said the security company. According to the company, the Toti SAPS then reached out to the Blue Security South Task Team, asking them to protect the seal through the night. “Neighbourhood groups were alerted and in no time we had a shift roster with dedicated volunteers enthusiastic to watch over the seal through the night,” said Blue Security. The security company said when the SPCA arrived early on Sunday, the seal was resting and safe. Amanzimtoti SPCA manager Tracey Girling said inspector Luke from the Toti SPCA as well as inspectors from the NSPCA spent most of the rest of the weekend observing the seal, and reporting to authorities specialising in monitoring such mammals. Girling said the seal was much better on Monday morning. “The seal was doing much better this morning and it was decided to move the seal to a quieter, safer location. “We thank members of the public for their concerns and a special thank you to the community neighbourhood watch for looking after the seal and making sure no harm came to (the mammal),” she said.
