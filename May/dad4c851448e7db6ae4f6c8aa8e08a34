Her firing came against the backdrop of the November local government elections last year, which led to the ANC losing major metros and later complaining about the public broadcaster’s coverage of the elections. Magopeni said in a statement that she took issue with the findings against her and would challenge them at the appropriate time and forum.  IOL
