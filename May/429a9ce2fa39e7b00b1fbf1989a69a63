DURBAN - A 64-YEAR-OLD woman from Ndwedwe used a bush knife to fight off an attacker who broke into her home, strangled and punched her, and attempted to rape her. Fikile Magwaza says she doesn’t know where she got the strength to strike the intruder in the head with a bush knife, at her age. Magwaza, who lives alone, heard someone outside her home at 9.30pm on Friday. “When he entered the house he told me not to scream, pushed me onto the bed and asked for money,” said Magwaza. She said she told him she didn’t have any money, and that is when he started to strangle her and punch her in the face repeatedly. “When he went to check if the door was closed properly, that is when I saw a bush knife on the floor and I quickly grabbed it and struck him on the head,” she said. He then tried to wrestle the knife from her; she threw it into the kitchen thinking he would go after it, and she could escape. Instead, he threatened to kill her if she continued to scream and fight. “He tried to force his knee between my legs and told me to take off my underwear,” said Magwaza. By then Magwaza said her two neighbours had heard her screams and came to her rescue. “They removed him and called the police and the ambulance,” she said. “I don’t wish to see him out of jail, after all the pain he has caused me.” She was still in pain and struggling to walk. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said: “A 42-year-old suspect was arrested. He is in hospital under police guard.” MOST READ: – KZN man shoots 2 sons dead, injures 3 others and turns gun on himself in dispute over new bed – Woman critical after surviving sixth floor jump in Durban – Woman,42, killed in alleged drive-by shooting in KwaMashu – Teen sisters speak of trauma after being raped during KZN house robbery, one of the rapists handed hefty sentence – Durban Solid Waste worker dies in truck accident while on duty THE MERCURY
