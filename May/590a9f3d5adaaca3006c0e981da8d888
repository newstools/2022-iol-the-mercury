Durban - A Cape Town-based foundation called Kasi Angels is on a mission to collect and donate 1 million pairs of school shoes under their campaign called #1MillionPairs. According to founder and chief executive Gerald Nomlala, the foundation was formed under the umbrella of the June 16 events firm. Nomlala said the sole purpose of the formation of the foundation was to perform charity work independently from commercial practices. “As a non-profit organisation, we saw an opportunity not only to do our charity communal work, but also to pitch ideas to corporates that require our tailor-made CSI projects, that we can execute on their behalf within poor townships and rural areas. “Kasi Angels is also a platform where people, especially women and youth, are given support, mentored, entertained, coached, and motivated to become better people, after having experienced life-changing life adversities,” said Nomlala. The organisation has partnered with corporations, such as Bata, Europcar, Motus, Hollywoodbets, Bidvest, Nedbank, and Concor Construction, who they say saw the same vision they have – which is to help children in need. The foundation travels around the country, responding to children who are in need of school shoes. They have donated school shoes in the Western Cape, North West, Gauteng, Northern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, and the Eastern Cape. As of Monday, the foundation was at KwaNdengezi Community Hall to donate school shoes. The foundation has reached the 40 000 mark of shoes they have donated since the start of their campaign. The foundation hopes to reach a million pairs by 2025. Kasi Angels wants more companies and individuals to be involved and donate to its foundation, to secure the education of the future leaders of this world. Their aim is to raise R23 million and purchase a million pairs of school shoes, and deliver at least 40 mobile classrooms. Daily News
