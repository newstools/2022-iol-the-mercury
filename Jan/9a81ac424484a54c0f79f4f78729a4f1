DURBAN - Two months after he was snatched from his mother, a baby boy has been reunited with her. Police said the mother and child were reunited after a 50-year-old woman was arrested for kidnapping. The child was snatched in November last year after the suspect befriended the mother in Durban. According to police, the mother alleged that an unknown woman approached and befriended her while she was waiting for a bus. The mother had just left King Edward Hospital carrying her six-day-old baby boy. Provincial police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the woman offered to buy groceries for the child after she learned that the mother was unemployed. “The complainant and the woman boarded a taxi to Dr Pixley Kaseme Street in Durban in order for the woman to purchase some clothes for the infant,” she said. Gwala said they went to a shop, at which point the unknown woman gave the complainant cash to purchase something for the baby. The suspect told the mother to leave the baby with her and she gave the mother money to go into the shop to buy the required items, she said. “The  complainant left her baby with the woman, who stood outside the shop. After a few minutes the mother of the child returned from the shop and discovered that the woman had disappeared with the infant,” said Gwala. Gwala said the suspect was traced and arrested in the uMgababa area yesterday. “The baby was reunited with his mother,” she said. Police said the suspect appeared in the Durban Magistrate’s Court today and was granted R5 000 bail. The matter was adjourned to March 1. THE MERCURY
