DURBAN - EFF KwaZulu-Natal chairperson Vusi Khoza says it is all systems go as they will slaughter four cattle today as part of the festivities for tomorrow’s Siyabonga rally to be held at People’s Park in Durban. The rally, which coincides with the ANC’s birthday celebrations, will be addressed by the party’s Commander in Chief Julius Malema and is part of thanking party members and supporters for “an impressive performance” in the local government elections. The EFF managed to more than double the number of councillors it had received, from 64 councillors in the 2016 to 164 councillors in the 2021 polls. “Interest in the Siyabonga rally has stretched beyond the borders of the country, with queries from eSwatini and Zimbabwe, it goes without saying that this is big and everyone is keen to be part of the festivities,” Khoza told The Mercury yesterday. He added that the slaughtering of cattle was a symbolic gesture in line with the party’s unapologetic stance of being proudly African. Fears have been expressed that the celebrations could draw a larger than manageable crowd and break Covid19 rules. However, Khoza stressed that while the party was expecting a “massive turnout”, the leadership would ensure that everything is done in line with the Covid-19 protocols. “We are not an irresponsible political organisation and we will not do something that puts the lives of our people, especially our members and supporters, in jeopardy, and so we will ensure that everything is done in line with the regulations” Khoza said. He added that while they had been hoping that Malema would also attend the slaughtering, he would only attend tomorrow owing to commitments. The holding of the rally on the same day that the ANC holds its January 8 birthday celebrations is seen by many as Malema’s way of testing the political waters and garnering further support ahead of the 2023 national elections.
