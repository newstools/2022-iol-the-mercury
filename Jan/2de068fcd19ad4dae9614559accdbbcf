CAPE TOWN - Five suspects, including three minors, have been arrested for alleged theft and vandalism of a power-supply cable in George worth about R1 million. The George Municipality commended law enforcement agencies and the SAPS for their swift action, following the vandalising of a power-supply cable connected to the 66kv situated at the back of the sewer pump station at Gwaing on New Year’s Day. The municipality suffered a huge financial loss with the theft of about 1 800m of cable worth about R1m. The retrieved cable is useless and cannot be reused. The municipality said two adults and three minors from Syferfontein have been arrested in connection with the incident, and would appear in court soon. “We would like to warn the public to refrain from stealing municipal property, as it is not only causing huge losses to the public’s coffers but also poses a danger to the lives of those tampering with energised cables,” said acting municipal manager, Michele Gratz. “Information available at this stage suggests that, although no spillages or damage to the pump station were caused, the electrical line was tripped by the suspected thieves.  “They could have been seriously injured or killed if the line had fallen on them or they had touched it while it was energised,” Gratz added. If a sewage spill occurred, the environmental and health implications would have been far-reaching for the community. George Municipality is offering a reward of R2 500 to any person with information on vandalism and theft incidents that could lead to the successful conviction of the perpetrators in court. Report illegal connections to 044 801 9222 or after hours on 044 801 6300. Report to 0860 044 044 with details eligible for the reward. Cape Times
