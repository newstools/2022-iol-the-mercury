DURBAN - THE Competition Commission says it will continue to monitor the pricing of school uniforms and urged schools to keep uniforms as generic as possible. After investigations into anti-competitive behaviour in the school uniform supply chain, the commission and the Department of Basic Education last year jointly released a circular guiding schools and stakeholders about best practice for procurement. The commission says that a survey would be rolled out over the next few weeks to assess the level of compliance. “The principle governing these guidelines include: Parents, who spoke to recently, said it would be nice for schools to give them the freedom of buying school uniforms at affordable stores. Sindi Gwabaza, of Mariannhill, said she had no choice but to follow the school rules because she wants the best for her 9-year-old daughter. “The school only gave us two suppliers where we can purchase the school uniforms. I wish local women could be given a chance to supply schools with uniforms,” she said. Nompumelelo Zungu, of Dannhauser in Newcastle, said buying school uniforms from a specific shop was expensive as they also needed to buy shirts that have a school badge. “We need to have options on where to buy school uniforms because we all cannot afford the supplier that the school has chosen for us,” she said. Nonjabulo Mbulu, of Malukazi, said they purchased uniforms from the school and had decided to start a WhatsApp group with other parents so that they can find a supplier. “The school sometimes has a shortage of sizes of the uniform and it is the only supplier where we can purchase the uniform.” THE MERCURY
