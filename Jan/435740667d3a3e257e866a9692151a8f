DURBAN – Beachgoers can return to the Thompson’s Bay Beach following an announcement by the KwaDukuza Municipality today that the beach has been reopened for public use. The beach was closed last week following a sewerage spillage incident.  It said at the time that the closure was due to an isolated incident of sewerage spillage on the main stormwater channel discharge point linked to the prolonged power outage experienced in the Ballito area.  The municipality said the beach had to be closed to allow for the water to be tested.  Municipal spokesperson Sipho Mkhize said: “Residents and stakeholders of the KwaDukuza Municipality are informed that Thompson’s Bay Beach is safe for public use and bathing following the precautionary closure on January 10. “Water test results received by the municipality confirm the quality to be good, hence the local authority’s decision to reopen the facility. “The municipality appreciates the high levels of co-operation shown during the past few days,” he said. The sewage spillage in KwaDukuza came a few days after the eThekwini Municipality was forced to close some of its beaches due to high E. coli  levels. The Durban beaches that were affected were reopened late last week.  THE MERCURY
