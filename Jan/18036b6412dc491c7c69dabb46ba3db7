DURBAN - THE KwaZulu-Natal Liquor Authority (KZNLA) has expressed concern over the number of special events that were held during the festive season where liquor was sold without special event permits. The chairperson of the KZNLA, Mbali Myeni, said during the festive season only a handful of special event applications were approved by the entity, which indicates that a substantial number of events were held  without an approved special event permit to allow them to sell liquor. Section 52 of the KwaZulu-Natal Liquor Licence Act 6 of 2010 states that any person who intends to engage in the retail sale of liquor at a special event for consumption on the premises must lodge an application for a special events permit with the Liquor Authority, in the prescribed manner, not less than 14 days prior to the date of the event, and pay the prescribed application fee in the prescribed manner.  She said the Act further states that any person who sells liquor at a special event without being in possession of a special events permit issued for that event is guilty of an offence. She added that they acknowledged the plight faced by event organisers as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and the uncertainty that was brought about by the prevalence of the fourth wave; however, people must adhere to the law. “The KZNLA will continue to work together with law enforcement agencies in order to combat illegal trading. We further call upon the public to report any events where liquor is being sold without a permit,” she said.
