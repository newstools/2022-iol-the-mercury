Durban - A 47-year-old man, who is accused of killing his toddler daughter and hiding her body in the ceiling of his home, will remain behind bars.  National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson in the North West Henry Mamothame said the accused, Mokete Legodi, 47, appeared in the Klerksdorp Magistrate’s Court today.  He said the matter was adjourned until January 24, for a date in the High Court.  “The State is also expected to serve the accused with an indictment.”  Mamothame said Legodi’s court appearance came after the lifeless body of his toddler daughter was discovered in the ceiling of his residential home in Alabama, near Klerksdorp.  “It is alleged that on May 13, Legodi went to his girlfriend’s home in Extension 20 in Jouberton and took their daughter without the consent of the mother who was admitted to the hospital at the time. “The family members who were taking care of the child assumed he would bring her back as he usually did. Later upon inquiry, he denied taking the child.” It is further alleged that when the mother was discharged from hospital on May 14, she, together with family members, went in search of the baby. A missing persons docket was subsequently opened at Jouberton police station. “Further investigations by the police led to the arrest of Legodi on May 16. He was charged with kidnapping after failing to tell the police the child whereabouts.” A day after his arrest, neighbours investigated a bad smell coming from his house and discovered the lifeless body of the child hidden inside the ceiling. The father faces charges of kidnapping and murder.  IOL
