DURBAN - OUTSTANDING matric pupils from Midlands schools said working smart was the way to achieve good results. The pupils said being active and working smart was the recipe behind their outstanding results. The pupils featured on the Independent Examinations Board Outstanding Achievements list. Jonathan le Roux, who attended Hilton College, said the final examinations were easy, it was the trials exams that challenged him. He said he did not feel the effects of Covid-19 and the riots as he was focusing on his studies. Furthermore, Jonathan said he was waiting to see whether he would be accepted to study statistics and data science at a US university. Giving his advice for the class of 2022, he said: “Just keep your head down; it’s only one year and it’s the only chance you have.” Alexander Brits, who attended Michaelhouse, said time management was one of his challenges during the exams. “I sometimes found that the time management was hard; exams were stressful. “However, the school provided the support,” he said. Alexander said that although he was not physically affected by the July unrest, he was worried about family and friends, which added to his stress. He said this year he wanted to be closer to his family as he is originally from Olivedale in Johannesburg. “I want to be close to my mom and dad because I have been boarding for eight years and that is why I want to go to the University of the Witwatersrand to study actuarial science,” he said. Alexander said this year’s matric class pupils should take breaks while studying for the exams. “Take breaks, go for walks and learn to manage your time well. “Most importantly, work hard but smartly.” THE MERCURY
